import { ArticleLayout } from '@/components/ArticleLayout';

export const article = {
  author: 'Gavin Woods',
  date: '2024-09-26',
  title: 'Migrated from Firebase to Vercel',
  description:
    'Since my website leverages SSR I had to migrate to a provider which supports it natively',
};

export const metadata = {
  title: article.title,
  description: article.description,
};

export default (props) => <ArticleLayout article={article} {...props} />;

Switching over to <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> was painless, my project now automatically deploys when new code is pushed to main with zero
repo configuration. It's free to use anf great for static and dynamic websites.
